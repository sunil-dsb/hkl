Objective of the HKL Website
Create an online presence that guides new users through a seamless journey from curiosity to a committed daily HKL practice. A user needs to go from  Awareness → Guided Onboarding → Habit Formation
Assume that the user coming to the website knows nothing about HKL


Overall Requirements
Website needs to make an emotional connection with the viewer quickly
Bold design that grabs attention and engages the users
It is a joy to use. 
Involves the user….have interactive elements
Conveys the benefit quickly and clearly
Conveys that HKL movement is not led by one particular religion or nation and in fact is a global, secular movement
Easy to navigate, especially on a mobile device. Fast
Multi-language capability (English, Punjabi, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Italian to start with)


The Guided User Journey
The website must be architected around the psychological state of a first-time visitor, someone seeking relief from stress or unhappiness but with low patience for unexplained jargon.
Stage 1: Awareness (First 5 Seconds): Immediate clarity on "What is this?" and "How does it help me?".
Stage 2: Guided Onboarding: A clear, functioning pathway to join the movement (= commit to the daily HKL Practice)
Stage 3: Habit Formation (Daily Practice): Digital tools that support the user in their actual morning practice.


Home Page
Immersive Video (full bleed) at the top
For now use footage from existing conferences
Later shoot a custom video (shoot outside; storyboard)

Explain how does it help the user
Then we 2 options for user journey (user makes a selection)
This solves the common "clutter" problem where experienced users have to dig through basic explanations to find daily tools
Journey 1 (I want to start now)
{The user understands HKL and we take them directly to the Section on Solution}
Journey 2 ( I want to understand more)
The user is not aware of HKL and we take them through a detailed journey as defined below

Ways to make websites interactive ... We need to transform the site into a "daily destination," which is essential for building a global movement.
Find different ways to make the website interactive so that we can involve and engage the user
Morning Tuning Widget: A prominent, mobile-optimized "Start My Morning" button that triggers a 2-minute guided audio for the daily HKL affirmation before a user's feet "touch the ground".
Daily Practice Tracker: A simple, browser-based "streak" mechanic to help users track their consecutive days of practice.
World Map with list of countries
Globe that rotates and the different cities light up
User joins HKL movement: Make this into a celebration. Confetti on page. World map spins to the country and lights up. Celebratory language. Downloadable card etc
Virtue Diagnostic Quiz: An interactive tool asking users about their current needs (e.g., "Peace from Stress," "Connection") to recommend specific content.
See example at https://kindness.org/kq/
…?
We are building around a daily ritual, not just information. The “Start My Morning” concept, plus reflections, reminders, and a weekly practice creates a real product feel.

About Us

Translations
1st pass by AI and then it will be manually reviewed and then put on website
Misc
We are in the process of using circle.so to host our community. How do we integrate it with our website (& app in future)
Perhaps a "Headless" integration or custom CSS for Circle so the transition between the HKL main site and the community space is visually seamless.
site must be GDPR/CCPA compliant
Multi-language SEO: We must implement hreflang tags so that search engines serve the correct language version to users in different countries

CMS Requirements
We need an easy way to update many parts of the website, including the following
Weekly practice text
Quotes
Conference details
Translations
Testimonials
story cards
meditation library
 speaker profiles
SEO metadata
 and site wide alerts.


Visual Language / Metaphors
Tree (we must uproot the root of Ego; HKL is the root and flowers are…)
Thorn and Flower
Ocean (storm and still)

Questions for our agency partner
What is the technical stack
Framer, Wix, Wordpress, or Custom Website ?
CMS choice
…
How to roll out the changes in Phases
We have a color palette that we use….but you also recommend designs that we should use
Perhaps a modern, minimalist typography and a color palette that feels "grounded" (earth tones or soft neutrals)
How do we visually represent "Humility, Kindness, and Love" without falling into "New Age" or "Religious" clichés?
A streak tracker, weekly poll, and journaling either require login or must be explicitly “device only” using local storage. We need to decide this
